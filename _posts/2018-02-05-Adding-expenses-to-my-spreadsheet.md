In today's lesson, we added our expenses to our spreadsheet to show how much money we would be making. To work this out we had to subtract things such as the food shop, and our weekly rent. The more difficult thing to add was the expense of the employees, to do this we had to times the hours worked and the pay per hour, and then add that to our expenses. To get our final total profit, we just subtract our expenses from our old total profit. I found this lesson relatively simple, as it was shown to us beforehand by our teacher.
