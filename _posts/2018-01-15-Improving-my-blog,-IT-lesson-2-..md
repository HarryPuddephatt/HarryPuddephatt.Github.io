In today's lesson, we were focused on improving our blogs, whether that be by adding a background image instead of one colour, or by adding tables onto your text. So in the lesson, I changed my text to purple, along with my post headings. This is so that the text would fit in with my background image more naturally. I also  added a table, I didn’t have time to edit the colour of the table as it was a very time consuming sub project, so it is just white at the moment. This doesn’t really fit in with the rest of the page, so next week I am planning on changing its colour to a darker purple as this will fit in more, but still make the text stand out from the background. I feel that I worked well this lesson, as I believe that I did a lot of work in the hour timeframe we were given.
