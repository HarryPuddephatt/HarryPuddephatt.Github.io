In today's lesson, we further devoted the level of complexity on our till system spreadsheet. We did this by adding stock, which is how much of something there is, as well as the buy in price. We then used the spreadsheet to multiply the sell price by amount sold, and then subtract that with the stock times by the buy in price. This feels us how much money we have received when factoring in the price it cost.

I found this relatively easy compared to some of the other things that we have done this term, and I think that I worked efficiently in the lesson.
