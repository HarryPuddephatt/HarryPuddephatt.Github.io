In today's lesson we learnt how to encode and decode messages using a shift cipher in google sheets. The lesson began with our teacher writing a code on the board and we had to decipher the message. After this we were given a brief introduction to coding and then we had to create a cipher to encode and decode messages. A shift cypher is where  I found that this was the most difficult thing that we have done so far in IT, as it required us to use all of our prior knowledge, and use it to work out how to complete a task.
