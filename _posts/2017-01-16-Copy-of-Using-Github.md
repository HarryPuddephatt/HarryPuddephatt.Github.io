    <td>I feel that it was easier to learn as we were working in pairs. This meant that we could discuss on what the best way of trying to solve the problem we had,and also we could work more efficiently on the task at hand, with one person writing the code and the other reading the manual.</td>

    <td>I believe that If we had set up the fuse boxes quicker, we would have been able to do more work, hence learning more about the way that the fuse boxes worked. So i feel that i should set up quicker next week.</td>
