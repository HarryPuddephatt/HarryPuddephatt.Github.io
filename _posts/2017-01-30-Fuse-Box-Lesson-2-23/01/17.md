    <td> At the beginning of this lesson Mr Keen came into the room and explained to us the two roles that you must fluctuate between. One of the partners has to be the navigator, who reads through the booklet and explains things to the driver, who writes the code in and runs the programs. I found this technique to help me to great effect.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I feel that we worked a bit slower than last time due to the addition of variables to our work, this meant that we had to create new projects, such as the apples variable introduction, where we add our previous lessons work to additional concepts that we learned about this week.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I feel that the set up time was again, not as fast as it could have been. Especially putting the equipment back into its original place. I feel that if we did this quicker and quicker each time, then the teacher will let us spend more time coding.</td>
