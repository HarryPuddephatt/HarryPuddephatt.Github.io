This is my first blog post, as I was at an orthodontist appointment for the first lesson. I do not feel as though this affected my learning too badly, as mr Tansley tried his best to catch me up with what we did in the previous lesson. 

In this lesson, we expanded on what we did in the first lesson, using a tool called Vlookup. This lets you assign a price to an item, then when you want the price to be sown, you can do it without having to go back and checking it every time you want to know. In this lesson we introduced percentage reduction to our till system. We learnt how we could change the details without having to redo the calculations. I feel like I did well in the lesson, seeing as I had had half the time to do the work. I think that I got very far.
