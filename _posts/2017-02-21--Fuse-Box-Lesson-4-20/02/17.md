    <td>
Today, we went through multiple sections of our instruction booklet. It did take me a while to fully understand exactly how to create imagery using binary.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? What habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I feel that I worked well today, although, It did take us some time before realising the mistake that we had made in the coding of our binary image.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Next lesson, I will be finishing the first chapter of this booklet, the code is very long so I will have to pay close attention to each of the individual characters.</td>
